## Company Background

AtliQ Hardware is a company that has grown vastly in recent years and opened businesses all over the globe. It sells computers and computer accessories through three mediums/channels:

- Retailers
- Direct
- Distributors

Recently, the company has faced an unforeseen loss by opening a store in America based on surveys, intuition, and some Excel analysis. Also, the company’s competitors have a handful of analytics teams to perform analysis and make data-driven decisions. So, AtliQ Hardware has no other option than building their analytics team for data-driven insights and decisions in the future to survive better in the industry.

## After the Project Kick-off Meetings

The data engineering team has provided the data as per the request of the data analytics team. Let’s explore them.

## Importing Data into Power BI

As the database is MySQL in this project, we need to import the datasets from MySQL database to Power BI by providing the Database access credential.

## Dashboard Designing

Based on the mockups received as a requirement, the team will start designing the visuals and create measures as and when required.
